    Generalist agents have proven their values over specialist agents by keeping task performance in the face of unpredictability. However, this generalizability has been considered only in the context of the controller, without considering its morphology, which brings an extra layer of complexity to this problem. In this paper, we utilized a variable incremental training schedule to co-evolve a morphology-controller pair that generalizes across wide range of environments. As a result, it was possible to co-evolve a generalist morphology-controller pair that still performed effectively in environments not encountered in the training data. Additionally, we examined the trade-offs between generalization and specialization for these agents. These experiments revealed that in certain cases, a generalist could outperform a specialist controller. This research offers extended insights into the co-evolution of morphology and control and evaluates the effectiveness of an existing generalization algorithm on a different problem set.

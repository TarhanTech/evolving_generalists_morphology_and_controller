%Intro on the research topic of finding a generalist morphology and controller pair for diverse environment (wie wat waar wanneer waarom en hoe).
Since Karl Sims' publication in 1994, 'Evolving Virtual Creatures' \cite{Karl_Sims_1994}, demonstrated virtual creatures interacting within a simulated three-dimensional physical environment, numerous researchers have pursued simultaneous co-evolution of both morphology and control \cite{Cheney_2017,Emma_Stensby_2021,Joshua_Auerbach_2014,Luis_2024}. By co-evolving both morphology and control, researchers can develop more effective AI agent systems for various tasks. This approach leverages the principle of embodied cognition, which suggests that intelligence arises not solely from the brain or an agent's control system, but from the dynamic interaction between the brain, body, and environment \cite{Josh_Bongard_2013}.

Moreover, co-evolving a morphology-controller pair (MC-pair) provides major benefits in robotic development, such as the ability to avoid the conventional physical design stage. Co-evolution enables to search for a potential morphological structures by evolving the MC-pair in a simulated environment, instead of wasting time iteratively redesigning and testing the robot in the physical world. Using an approach like this can furthermore speed up the development process and encourage the creation of more innovative morphologies that might not have been thought of in more traditional designs or deemed plausible.

Unfortunately, an evolved MC-pair will still specialize on the environment it has been trained in. This specialization occurs because the evolutionary process fine-tunes both the morphology and controller to the specific conditions of the training environment, resulting in high task performance in only the training environments but reduced task performance to new or marginally different environments. In the real-world, environments are inherently dynamic and unpredictable. Factors such as changing weather conditions, varying terrains, and unforeseen obstacles can significantly alter the operational context of an agent. This variability poses a substantial challenge to the robustness and generalizability of evolved MC-pairs. For example, an agent accustomed to smooth interior surfaces would find it difficult to maneuver over muddy, gravelly, or steeply inclined outdoor terrains. Agents created for static surroundings may also not be able to adjust to environments with changing lighting or moving impediments. Therefore, research into evolving a generalist MC-pair that can operate effectively across a wide range of environments is critically important.

To overcome this limitation, it is crucial to focus on developing robustness and generalizability in evolved agents. Robustness refers to the ability of an agent to maintain desirable behavior despite variations or perturbations in its input and output data \cite{Ravi_Mangal_2019, Charles_Packer_2019, Xu_Mengdi_2022}. Generalizability, on the other hand, refers to the ability of an agent to maintain desirable behavior under different conditions to those encountered during training \cite{Charles_Packer_2019,Xu_Mengdi_2022}. 

In this paper, we investigate the co-evolution of a generalist MC-pair for a wide range of environments, utilizing the Farama Gymnasium's Ant-v4 task \cite{Gymnasium2023} as our testing framework. We modified it to allow for the evolution of both the leg lengths and widths of the Ant, thereby adapting its morphology to suit various environments. Our training methodology is heavily based on the training algorithm specified by Triebold et al. \cite{Corinna_Triebold} with minor modification tailored to our objective of evolving a robust and general MC-pair for wide range of environments. \textbf{Our results show...}

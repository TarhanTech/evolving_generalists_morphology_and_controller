\section{Conclusion}
    This work has presented a comprehensive investigation of the co-evolution of morphology and control, highlighting its benefits, such as eliminating the need to design the morphology prior to training and the potential to evolve more innovative and performant agents. However, it also addresses the challenges associated with evolving MC-pairs, such as premature convergence and embodied cognition. We examined the possibility of evolving an MC-pair that will generalize across a wide range of environments. To achieve this, we employed the XNES evolutionary strategy, where the morphology and ANN parameters are both optimized simultaneously, in conjunction with an incremental and variable training schedule.
